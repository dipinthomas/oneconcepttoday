  {
    "question": "What is the difference between S3 and EBS?",
    "answer": "S3 is object storage accessible via REST API, while EBS provides block-level storage volumes for EC2 instances.",
    "explanation": "S3 is designed for storing files, documents, and media accessible from anywhere on the internet. EBS provides persistent block storage for EC2 instances, similar to a traditional hard drive that can be attached to virtual machines."

    "question": "What is AWS Lambda?",
    "answer": "AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that runs code in response to events without managing servers.",
    "explanation": "Lambda automatically manages the computing resources for you, scaling from a few requests per day to thousands per second. You only pay for the compute time you consume, making it cost-effective for sporadic workloads."

    "question": "What is the difference between Availability Zones and Regions?",
    "answer": "A Region is a physical location with multiple Availability Zones. An Availability Zone is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power and networking.",
    "explanation": "Regions are completely independent and help achieve the greatest possible fault tolerance. Availability Zones within a region are connected through low-latency links and enable you to operate production applications that are more highly available than from a single data center."

  {
    "question": "What is Amazon CloudFront?",
    "answer": "CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs globally with low latency.",
    "explanation": "CloudFront speeds up distribution of your content by caching it at edge locations closest to your users. This reduces latency and provides better performance for your web applications."
